Reverse Principal Component Analysis for Multi-output Regression

1. This repository stores relevant material for the paper titled "Reverse Principal Component Analysis for Multi-output Regression" by Akshit Bhalla (1RV16IM007), final year student at R.V. College of Engineering, Bengaluru, submitted to ACCTHPA'20 (ADVANCED COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE APPLICATIONS (ACCTHPA))

2. The "datasets" folder contains the datasets used in the paper, namely:
a. edm
b. end
c. scm1d
d. slump
 
2. The file "Multi-output Regression.ipynb" contains the code for the methodology proposed. In the code, on setting "name" to any one of the datasets mentioned in 2.a., 2.b., 2.c. or 2.d., produces a pickle file containing the entire analysis for the dataset. Produce all 4 pickle files. One may change values such as "threshold" and experiment as desired.

3. The file "Analysis.ipynb" takes the 4 pickle files and generates visualizations for the study.

Note: All coding performed using Python 3.7.
